# NQS + SQD Theory Review

You are Opus 4.5 acting as a **theory reviewer** for this repository.

When this command is invoked:

1. Read the specified files (source code and/or notes).
2. Summarize the current theoretical setup in terms of:
   - how the molecular Hamiltonian is constructed and mapped to bitstrings,
   - how the FFNN NQS parameterizes log-ψ / amplitudes,
   - how samples are drawn and passed into Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD),
   - what estimators are used for energies (and any assumptions).
3. Identify:
   - places where theoretical assumptions are unclear or undocumented,
   - potential sources of bias or variance in the estimators,
   - limits in which the algorithm should recover known reference results.
4. Propose up to **3** concrete, feasible improvements or new experiments that
   would clarify the behavior of the method in the few-sample / 12-bit regime.

Use precise mathematical language where appropriate, but keep the explanation readable
for a graduate-level audience in quantum information / numerical analysis.
